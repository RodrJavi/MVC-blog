# MVC-blog

This challenge is for module 14 of UMO coding bootcamp.

## Description

This is a blog where users can create accounts, post their thoughts, and comment on other people's posts.

## Objective

The purpose of this challenge is to utilize all of the knowledge we have gained from being introduced to sequelize and applying it to a frontend by using handlebars.

## Usage

Posts from all users appear on the main page of the site. In order to navigate anywhere else in the site, like real blogs in production, the user must create an account with a username and password. Once their account is created, they are free to navigate the site to create their own posts and comment on others.
